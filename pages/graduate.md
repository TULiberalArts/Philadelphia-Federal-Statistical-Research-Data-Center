## MLA Program Outline

The hallmark of the MLA Program is its interdisciplinary flexibility in allowing students to develop their own intellectual and career pathways. MLA students can choose from a range of courses and disciplines in both the MLA Program or other CLA graduate programs that meet their needs and interests, including: Art History, History, English, Anthropology, Psychology, Philosophy, Sociology, Religion, Political Science, African American Studies, and Geography and Urban Studies. In addition, the MLA programs affords students the opportunity to: participate in a varied and rich student network, across different generations, academic interests, and professional ambitions; improve their analytical, research, and writing skills; challenge themselves intellectually; enhance their current positions or open doors to new career possibilities.

## Degree Requirements

NOTE: As per Graduate School Policy #02.25.11 on "Continuous Enrollment/Registration":

"To remain in Academic Good Standing, a graduate student must maintain continuous enrollment (i.e., 1 or more s.h. each Fall and Spring; also in the Summer for those students graduating in the summer) from the semester of matriculation through the semester of graduation" (see: http://www.temple.edu/grad/policies/gradpolicies.htm).

Students must enroll during the semester in which they are admitted. Leave of Absences are not permitted during the first semester of admittance, but may be granted for subsequent semesters. Should a Leave of Absence be necessary, the student must submit a completed Leave of Absence form, plus fee, to the Office of Graduate Affairs, 12th Anderson Hall (Dean's Office).

There are two primary components toward successful completion of the MLA degree: coursework and qualifying paper.

**Courses**:

- 10 graduate courses (30 credits) are required for the degree.

**Of these 10 courses**:

MLA 8011 Introduction to Interdisciplinary Studies is required.
This course combines a more typical interdisciplinary thematic course with an emphasis on methods and skills for doing research at the graduate level. Ideally, this course will be taken by all incoming MLA students either during the semester of matriculation, or shortly thereafter.

Any three “Topics” or other MLA courses are required.
These courses are offered every semester and turn on a variety of interdisciplinary topics, such as: Gender Issues, Race, Visual Culture, Popular Culture, Politics and Society, The Arts and Contemporary Culture, Religion and Society, Modern Intellectual Traditions, The Classical Traditions, Global Cultures, and Urban Culture.

Effective Immediately: what were formerly known as “Foundations” courses will no longer be offered; as such, all current and incoming students are no longer required to take these courses.]

Six other courses, or "electives."
These courses can be selected from additional MLA courses and/or a wealth of graduate offerings from departments across the College of Liberal Arts that are tailored to the student's individual plans for study, qualifications, necessary course prerequisites, etc. Up to two graduate courses can be taken from outside both the MLA program and the College of Liberal Arts. (Please consult the MLA Advisor.)

[NOTE: Because the subject matter and areas of focus for MLA courses vary from semester to semester, students are permitted to register for the same course multiple times. This excludes MLA 8011.]

## Qualifying Paper:

A Qualifying Paper is required for the degree.

In their last year or last semester, students must complete an essay, or Qualifying Paper (may be a creative project), that represents the culmination of their individual plans of study.   It must demonstrate the student's’ ability to write analytically on a topic of their choice; to read, absorb, evaluate, and cite scholarly thought and research; and to establish and develop a sound perspective on the topic under consideration. 

For information on the Qualifying Paper, visit: http://www.temple.edu/mla/qualifying/index.html

## Graduation:

Students intending to graduate in any given semester (or summer) must:

1) be enrolled in at least one graduate credit during the semester (or summer) in which they intend to graduate (Please consult graduate policy #02.25.11 referenced above.)

2) both apply online through Banner and print out a hard copy of the application to submit to CLA Graduate Affairs, 1216 Anderson Hall (12th Floor).

To apply online, sign into TPortal, then go to "Self-Service Banner," then "Main Menu: Student," the "Student Records," then "Apply to Graduate."

Late applications will not be accepted.

NOTE: Master’s students are no longer required to pay a fee with this application.

## Coursework Taken as a Non-Degree Seeking Student:

Up to nine hours of graduate study taken at Temple prior to admission may be credited toward the degree with the approval of the MLA Advisory Committee and the Dean of the Graduate School. In order for graduate courses taken at Temple as a non-degree seeking student to count toward the degree, the earned grades must be “B” or better.

## Course Offerings

MLA courses are usually offered in small seminar settings (7 to 12 students) which provide opportunities for lively engagement and exchange of ideas among the students and the professor.   As with most graduate courses, students may be expected to give oral presentations and to submit written assignments, often including a substantial end-of-term paper.

Most MLA courses are usually offered during the evening at Temple University’s Center City campus at 1515 Market Street, very close to City Hall. A typical course meets once a week, from 6:00 to 8:30 p.m.  Some online or "blended" courses, with variable meeting times, may also be offered.

In addition, a number of other graduate courses in the College of Liberal Arts and across the University are offered on Main Campus, typically during the day or early evening. The MLA program also offers "cross-listed" courses with other academic departments.

## Registering for courses:

For general information regarding registration, please go to: [http://www.temple.edu/registrar/students/registration/info.asp](http://www.temple.edu/registrar/students/registration/info.asp)

NON-DEGREE SEEKING students interested in registering for MLA courses need to first contact the Office of Continuing Studies (see especially "Graduate Students" section).

NEWLY ADMITTED DEGREE SEEKING will be registered by the MLA program during the first semester of enrollment (to include, barring any complications, MLA 5011 Introduction to Interdisciplinary Studies).

After the first semester of enrollment, all CONTINUING DEGREE SEEKING students should be able to register on their own via Self-Service Banner in TUportal.
