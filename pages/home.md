In conjunction with the Office of the Vice President for Research, the College of Liberal Arts has been the leading force behind Temple Universityâ€™s membership in the newly created Philadelphia Federal Statistical Research Data Center (FSRDC).  Through this FSRDC, Temple faculty and students will be able to conduct statistical analysis of a wide range of non-public microdata collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and other government agencies.

PFSRDC is a secure computer lab at the Philadelphia Federal Reserve through which qualified researchers with approved projects can access data residing on the Census Bureau servers.
