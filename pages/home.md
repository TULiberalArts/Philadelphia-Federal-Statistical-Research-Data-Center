  In conjunction with the Office of the Vice President for Research, the College of Liberal Arts has been the leading force behind Temple Universityâ€™s membership in the newly created Philadelphia Federal Statistical Research Data Center (PFSRDC).  Through the PFSRDC, Temple faculty and students are able to conduct statistical analysis of a wide range of non-public microdata collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and other government agencies.</br></br>The PFSRDC is a secure computer lab at the Philadelphia Federal Reserve through which qualified researchers with approved projects can access restricted data residing on the Census Bureau servers. To gain access to the data, researchers must <a href="/philadelphia-federal-statistical-research-data-center/research">submit a project proposal</a> for approval by the Agency that provides the data. All proposals must be submitted through the <a href="/philadelphia-federal-statistical-research-data-center/contact">PFSRDC Administrator</a>.
